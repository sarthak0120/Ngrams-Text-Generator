A pioneering group of physicists in the mid-1900s realized that if you were to shut off the sun, 
remove the other stars from the Milky Way, and even sweep away the more distant galaxies, space 
would not be black. To the human eye it would appear black, but if you could see radiation in the 
microwave part of the spectrum, then every which way you turned you’d see a uniform glow. 
Its origin? The origin. Remarkably, these physicists discovered a pervasive sea of microwave 
radiation filling space that is a present-day relic of the universe’s creation. The story of this 
breakthrough recounts a phenomenal achievement of the big bang theory, but in time it also revealed 
one of the theory’s fundamental shortcomings and thus set the stage for the next major breakthrough 
in cosmology after the pioneering works of Friedmann and Lemaître: the inflationary theory. 
Inflationary cosmology modifies the big bang theory by inserting an intense burst of enormously 
fast expansion during the universe’s earliest moments. This modification, as we will see, proves 
essential to explaining some otherwise perplexing features of the relic radiation. But more than 
that, inflationary cosmology is a key chapter in our story because scientists have gradually 
realized over the last few decades that the most convincing versions of the theory yield a vast 
collection of parallel universes, radically transforming the complexion of reality.
